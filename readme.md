You are required to create a simple web application that allows users to submit a monetary transaction. The application should consist of a front-end built with React and a back-end using Node.js and Express. The application should allow users to input the transaction amount and a description, and upon submission, it should display the transaction details on the front-end.

### Requirements

1.  **Front-End (React)**

    *   Create a form that accepts:

        *   Transaction Amount (number)
        *   Transaction Description (text)

    *   On form submission, display the transaction details below the form.

2.  **Back-End (Node.js + Express)**

    *   Set up a simple Express server that handles POST requests to save transaction data.
    *   Implement a GET endpoint to retrieve the transaction data.
    *   Use an in-memory array to store transactions (no database required for this challenge).

### Constraints

*   The challenge should be completed in less than 30 minutes.
*   Use only free resources and libraries and NO AI Tools.
